# My First Blog Post on this

Published on: 2025-08-04

Welcome to my _new blog_ on the Terrifying Angelino!

## What I've accomplished

1. **consulting Elders**: First, I consult with the Elders. They are wise and knowledgable.

2. **gathering mats**: I then journey out to gather all the `.astro` mats my Elder told me to get. I placed them in the `src/pages/` bags.

3. **tactical outcome**: round them up and take em out!

## What's next

Here.
